### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Nick, software engineer from UK/Germany, currently living in Madrid, Spain.**

I have a diverse background in the automotive, EdTech, and consulting industries. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Business Technology at IE University in Madrid. My BSc degree from University of Bath, international background, and fluency in multiple languages have equipped me with a strong foundation in computer science and the ability to adapt to different environments.
